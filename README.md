## napd: The Napster Server That Never Wuz

Just after the the DotCon bubble *POP* Dan Brumleve was writing a Napster server in C++.

Foreshadowing [my enthusiasm for Algorithmic Information Theory](http://prize.hutter1.net/#history), and knowing his mathematical bent, I encouraged him to write a maximally-factored implementation.

The result is what you see in this repo.

It was never deployed for historic reasons that are now obvious.

Nevertheless, it may prove valuable as an example of what a relatively talented young mathematician programmer could do to approximate the Algorithmic Information of a software specification.
